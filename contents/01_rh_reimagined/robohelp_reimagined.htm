  <h1>Adobe RoboHelp Reimagined</h1>
  <p class="Emphasis1">This sample project describes the new version of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> and walks you through how to use the features. Some of the images may have detail changes in the released version of <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
  <p>Since Adobe acquired RoboHelp,sdfssdfsds there have been some great new features added. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> is a complete rewrite with a reimagined user interface using modern design paradigms. <span lang="EN-GB"
      style="font-size: 10.0pt;" xml:lang="EN-GB">This enables new features and fixes to be developed much more rapidly and</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">demonstrates Adobe&#39;s commitment to this major authoring tool.</span></p>
  <p>Existing users will recognise <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> as having a much more modern look and feel and, along with new users, they will see something that is easy to work with.</p>
  <h2>New User Interface</h2>
  <p>The UI is very different. It&#39;s all explained in <a href="../working_with_rh/ui.htm">User Interface</a> and Creating Topics in the Table of Contents.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/images/ui_01.png" style="border: none;" /></p>
  <h2>Contents Panel shows what is in File Explorer</h2>
  <p>No longer do you have to import images and other files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="Standard_Bullet">
      <p>If a file is in the project folders in File Explorer, it will show in Contents above.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="Standard_Bullet">
      <p>If you rename a file in File Explorer, the change will show in Contents above.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>HTML5 and CSS3 Supported</h2>
  <p>The new editor supports both HTML5 and CSS3. Previously HTML5 outputs were generated from HTML4 code in the source topics.</p>
  <h2>SVG, WebP and Font Awesome</h2>
  <p>These image formats are supported in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
  <h2>New Skin Editor</h2>
  <p>Previously each HTML5 layout had its own skin editor and what you could do varied with each skin. Now all the layouts will have the same skin editor with greater functionality that will also allow the editing of WebHelp skins.</p>
  <h2>Resource Linking</h2>
  <p>Resource Manager has been replaced by Resource Linking.</p>
  <h2>Source Control</h2>
  <p>GIT and SharePoint Online are now supported. Other source control systems will be added later.</p>
  <h2>Multi Author</h2>
  <p>In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> more than one author can work on a project without source control. This does not allow different authors to work on the same topic or for different authors to work simultaneously on the same
    feature, such as the TOC. Use with care.</p>
  <p>This can be done across a network or using cloud based projects.</p>
  <p class="Emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" style="border: none;" /> Always backup the project before you start multi-authoring this way.</p>
  <h2>RoboScreen Capture</h2>
  <p>RoboScreen Capture will be installed but it will not be directly accessible from <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
  <p>Open it from Windows &gt; Start.</p>
  <h2>Baggage Files Simplified</h2>
  <p>Add the file in the Contents Panel and then add it to the TOC. If you don&#39;t want users to see it in the TOC, tick Hide in Output in the Properties Panel.</p>
  <h2>Emails</h2>
  <p>You can now create a draft email that users can click in the <a href="../toc_index_glossary/toc.htm">The Table of Contents</a> to open the email in their default email program.</p>
  <h2>Microsoft Word Not Required</h2>
  <p>No more issues with having a compatible version of Word installed. You do not need any version of Word installed. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> will import and link to any DOCX file. For Printed Documentation you willl be able
    to create either a PDF or ODF file.</p>
  <p>ODF files are supported by Word and can be opened in Microsoft Word 2013 or higher and many other word processing tools such as Open Office and Libre Office.</p>
  <h2>Format Painter</h2>
  <p>Select some text that is formatted the way you want and then copy it to other text.</p>

<h1>The Contents Panel</h1>
<p>The Contents Panel shows all the topics in the project, rather like 
 Project Manager in older versions of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/ui.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>With a topic open, the Right Panel shows the Properties and 
	 Styles.</p></li>
	<li><p>Properties reveals Element and Topic information.</p></li>
	<li><p>Styles shows the styles in the CSS selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Working in the Contents Panel</h2>
<p>Here you will the assets folder along with whatever structure you create 
 for topics. If you look in File Explorer, you well see the project structure 
 differs from earlier versions. </p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/contents_01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>If you look at the project in File Explorer, you will see the 
	 root folder contains the rhpj file that opens the project.</p></li>
	<li><p>Your files are in the Contents folder where you will also find 
	 the Assets folder. All the other folders are for the <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> internal files.</p></li>
	<li><p>You will also see JSON files in your project. These are cache 
	 files used by <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. 
	 Don&#39;t touch! </p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Assets folder is new. The idea is to keep your images, CSS and suchlike 
 separate from your topics with their own organizational structure.</p>
<p>Right click any folder or file and you will see the various options 
 available, similar to previous versions.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you upgrade, all the image, 
 media and CSS files will be moved from their existing locations into an 
 Assets folder. The folder structure of your project will be retained for 
 folders containing such files. <br/>
For example, if you had all your images in a folder named Images and your 
 media files in a folder named Media, in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 you will see Assets &gt; Images and Assets &gt; Media.</p>
<p>When you open a topic that is in the Contents Panel, the content appears 
 alongside with its Properties in the Right Panel. See <a href="working_on_topics.htm">Working 
 on Topics</a></p>
<h2>The Contents Panel Context Menu</h2>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> There&#39;s a great new feature 
 here, Import Folder. Click that and you can then browse to any drive you 
 can see and select a whole folder of, for example, images or you can browse 
 and select multiple images and add them in one go.</p>

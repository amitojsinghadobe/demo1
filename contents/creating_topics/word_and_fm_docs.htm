<h1>Word and FrameMaker Docs</h1>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Both Importing and Linking have 
 been greatly simplified.</p>
<h2>Importing Word Documents</h2>
<p>Click File &gt; Import and browse to the document you want to import 
 to start the process.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You don&#39;t have to have any version 
 of Word installed on your computer. You can import any Word document created 
 in Word 2013 or higher and saved in DOCX format.</p>
<p>Initially use the default.wsf (Word Settings File) and browse to the 
 document to be imported. As soon as you have selected the document, in 
 the bottom right corner of the window you will see <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 quickly reads it so that you can proceed with the other settings.</p>
<h3>General Settings</h3>
<p>Select the CSS file to be used for mapping and select the style to be 
 used as the break point if you want separate topics based on a style.</p>
<p>Set the Topic Name Pattern if you want something other than the default.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_general.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<p>In most cases the settings below will work best.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_advanced.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Character Settings</h3>
<p>Your settings here will depend on your end objective.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If you want to retain the appearance 
	 of the Word document, set it to Import Word Style. You can click the 
	 Mapped Style dropdown to see the Word Style and you can change the 
	 mapping to another style.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If you want the topic to look like any 
	 other topic, select Discard Style.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See Mapping below.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Word documents retain many styles 
 that are not used in the document, especially documents that have been 
 worked on by many people. Previously all the style would have appeared 
 here for mapping. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 only the styles in use will appear.</p>

<h3>Table Settings</h3>

<p> </p>
<h3>List Settings</h3>

<h5>Saving Your Settings</h5>
<p>Before you click Import, if you have made any changes to the defaults, 
 click Save Preset to avoid having to make those changes again. Next time 
 you import, the last WSF file saved will appear but you can choose any 
 other configuration you have saved.</p>
<h2>Mapping</h2>
<p>If you choose Discard Style as described earlier, <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will attempt to map the styles in the Word document to styles that 
 are in the CSS you selected in the General settings.</p>
<p>The styles it can map will be in the topic(s) created and be much cleaner 
 than previous versions of Adobe RoboHelp.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If all the styles can be mapped a CSS, 
	 the CSS you used for mapping will be applied to the topic(s) and shown 
	 in the topic properties.<br/>
	Going forward any changes to your CSS would then be applied to the 
	 imported topic(s) in the same way as all other topics.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If any styles cannot be mapped because 
	 they are unique to the Word document, then in topic properties you 
	 will see the CSS you used for mapping and a second CSS file <word_doc_name.css>. 
	 <word_doc_name.css> will contain definitions for the styles 
	 that could not be mapped.<br/>
	Going forward, the styles in your main CSS can be changed and 
	 will apply to the imported topic(s). The styles in the second 
	 CSS will need to be changed where they no longer work with your 
	 main CSS. You could paste them into the end of your main CSS and no 
	 longer have a link to the second CSS.</word_doc_name.css></word_doc_name.css></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in both cases, if you selected Import Inline Styles, they 
 will be written into <word_doc_name.css>.</word_doc_name.css></p>
<h2>Linking Word Documents</h2>
<p>Simply right click in the Contents Panel and select Link Word Document 
 and browse to any DOCX file or files, you can link to more than one DOCX 
 file at a time.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/contents_01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
A folder will be shown in the Contents Panel with the name of the linked 
 document. Right click the folder, select Generate HTML and your topic 
 will be created.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/link01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Right click the folder, select Generate HTML and your topic will be 
 created.</p>
<h2>FrameMaker Documents</h2>
<p>With every release of FrameMaker, the output has gone through many improvements 
 and using FrameMaker to create the output directly is recommended.</p>
<p>Creating an output from <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will be added later.</p>

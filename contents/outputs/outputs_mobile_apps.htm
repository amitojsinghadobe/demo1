<h1>Mobile App Output</h1>
<p>You can also create the content of your project as an app for Apple 
 and Android devices. This can be useful in many scenarios where the user 
 requires information but may not have guaranteed online access. Medical 
 staff having to work in remote locations without internet access would 
 be an example.</p>
<h2>Creating a Mobile App Output</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either come back here next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The options are similar to previous versions and are described in detail 
 in the online help.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.<br/>

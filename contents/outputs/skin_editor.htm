<h1>The Skin Editor</h1>
<p>In earlier versions WebHelp had Skins and Responsive HTML5 Help had 
 layouts. The terminology has now changed. Layouts refers to the underlying 
 functionality, the foundations. The term Skins will now be used for both 
 outputs and both can be edited in the new Skin Editor.</p>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings and then click Skins. When you select 
 what you want to edit, a preview will display on the left along with the 
 Skin Components you can customize. As you click each component, its properties 
 will be displayed on the right for editing.</p>

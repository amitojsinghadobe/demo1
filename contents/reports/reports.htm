<h1>Reports</h1>
<p>Reports are now much easier to read on screen and are produced much 
 faster than before. The reports available are listed in the left panel 
 and various properties and options appear in the right panel.</p>
<p>Where you see File Name as a Sort Option, it refers to the name of the 
 topic the item is used in.</p>

<h1>Single Sourcing Using Condition Tags</h1>
<p>Single sourcing is a method of applying condition tags to topics, content 
 in topics, toc books and pages and index entries so that the tag can be 
 included in a build expression to exclude it from a chosen output. For 
 example, a single topic could contain additional information only to be 
 seen in certain outputs, perhaps a printed output needs an image not required 
 in online versions. Essentially it means a single project (source) can 
 produce multiple outputs, each with different content. This is done by 
 using Conditional Tags.</p>
<h2>How do Condition Tags Work?</h2>
<p>The concept is best explained using an example. Let&#39;s say you are producing 
 a knowledge base for your company with some content that applies to everyone, 
 some applies only sales staff and some only applies to admin staff. Also 
 sales staff and admin staff must not see each others content. In that 
 scenario <a href="../outputs/dynamic_content.htm">Dynamic Content Filtering</a> 
 would not work as both could see the content for the other. You need to 
 generate separate outputs for each group.</p>
<p>In this example you would to create two condition tags labelled say 
 Sales and Admin.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows the default condition tag groups. You can edit 
 their names and add or remove the groups in Project Settings.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Here though Audience suits our purposes so click the + icon, select 
 the group in the dropdown that displays and set the color for it.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" style="border: none;" alt="" border="0"/> When you set the color for any 
 tag, also set the opacity to 50 or lower so that the text is still legible.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>With the required tags set up, you now create your content. Here two 
 paragraphs have been set up with content for a specific audience.</p>
<p>Simply select the text to which the condition tag is to be applied, 
 right click and select Apply Condition Tags.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tags03.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>In the Preview you can select specific tags such as Sales to see what 
 the Sales staff would see, the first two paragraphs. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;" alt="" border="0"/> Keep in mind that when 
 you generate your output, the expression you create there could reverse 
 that.</p>
<p>You can also set a condition at topic level in the Properties </p>
<h2>Using Condition Tags in an Expression</h2>
<p>In Output &gt; Output Settings, click Condition Expressions, then click 
 the + icon to create an expression.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tags04.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
As you drag tags, by default <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will set the tag to be excluded and additional tags will be set to be 
 AND.</p>
<p>Thus if you drag both Sales and Admin, by default the expression will 
 be Exclude Sales AND Exclude Admin. However, you can easily change Exclude 
 to Include and you can change AND to OR.</p>
<h2>Generating an Output</h2>
<p>By using different expressions, you can generate different outputs for 
 different audiences, such as in the example above, or you could apply 
 the Print condition tag to images and then exclude the images from online 
 help but include them in Printed Documentation and so on.</p>
<p>In the Output Presets you can either select the required expression 
 each time you generate or you can create one or more presets and set each 
 one up with a specific expression. In this example you might set up Responsive 
 HTML5 Sales and Responsive HTML5 Admin.</p>

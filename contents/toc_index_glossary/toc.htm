<h1>The Table of Contents</h1>
<h2>The TOC Controls Your Outputs</h2>
<p>There is a big change in what goes into an output in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. In earlier versions, 
 an output contained everything that was in Project Manager that was not 
 excluded by the build expression. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 it is controlled by the table of contents.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every 
 topic that you want in the output must be in the TOC or have a link from 
 a topic that is in the TOC.</span></p>
<p>You may not want users to see a TOC with every topic that can be accessed, 
 some you may just want to be links from other topics. Not every topic 
 has to be included in the TOC. Let&#39;s say you have a topic that has links 
 to say twenty others that give supplementary information. Only that one 
 topic needs to be in the TOC as the links will automatically pull in the 
 twenty supplementary topics. That does not prevent you from including 
 any or all of the twenty, it&#39;s just that you don&#39;t have to.</p>
<h2>Baggage Files</h2>
<p>Because the TOC controls what goes into an output, you also use it to 
 add baggage files to the output. Baggage files are files you want in the 
 build when you generate but that are not referenced anywhere.</p>
<p>When you click Insert Pages while editing a TOC, as shown below in Adding 
 Items to the TOC, there will be an option Local Files. Select the baggage 
 file you want to add and it will be uploaded when you generate. If you 
 don&#39;t want the baggage file to appear in the TOC, just tick Hide in Output 
 in the Properties panel.</p>
<h2>Using the TOC</h2>
<p>To see the Table of Contents in an upgraded project or to create a new 
 one, click the TOC icon in the left toolbar.<br/>
</p>

<p>If you right click in the Table of Contents Panel shown, the options 
 below will be shown and you can edit in that area.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/toc_02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
If you prefer a larger area to work in, click the menu icon and select 
 edit. The TOC will open in the authoring area to the right and icons shown 
 above will appear in the top toolbar. The TOC Properties will be displayed 
 in the Right Panel.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Adding Items to the TOC</h2>
<p>Click New Page to display this dialog.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/toc_insert.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
Note the options. You can add Project Files, Local Files outside your project 
 (Baggage Files), links to Web Pages and create draft emails for your users.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Creating emails is new. The 
 title will appear in the TOC. Clicking that page will open the email in 
 the users default email program.</p>

<h1>Upgrading to <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span></h1>
<p>There are big changes to the code in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 as it is HTML5 and CSS3 based. Projects created in earlier versions will 
 not be truly upgraded in the normal sense, instead your old project is 
 left untouched and a copy is made on the fly. It is that copy that is 
 upgraded. That means that you retain your project in its old format by 
 way of a backup.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You are nonetheless recommended 
 to retain a backup copy in either source control and/or a zipped copy. 
 <br/>
A zipped copy prevents you opening it accidentally and working on it before 
 you realise it was the backup. Also you always have a clean backup that 
 can be used to create a new clean copy time after time. Prefixing the 
 zip file with the date is good practice. YYMMDD_MyProject.zip.</p>
<h2>Converting the Project to <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 Format</h2>
<p>When you are ready to convert your project created in any earlier version 
 of RoboHelp, then on the Starter Page click Upgrade Project or Click File 
 &gt; Upgrade RoboHelp Classic Project and browse to the main folder of 
 your existing project.</p>
<p>Click Open to display the New Project dialog.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/new_project_dialog.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
Complete as required and click Create.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you upgrade, all the image, 
 media and CSS files will be moved from their existing locations into the 
 &quot;assets&quot; folder you see below. The folder structure of your 
 project will be retained for folders containing such files. <br/>
For example, if you had all your images in a folder named Images and your 
 media files in a folder named Media, in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 you will see Assets &gt; Images and Assets &gt; Media. Wherever they are 
 pre-upgrade, the structure will be mirrored within Assets.</p>
<h2>The Upgrade</h2>
<p>In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 your project will look like this, &quot;project_files&quot; being the 
 name of the folder that was created in the earlier version.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/imported_project.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You can, of course, change your 
 folder and file names in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 but there&#39;s something new. Change the folder name in Windows Explorer 
 and it will be immediately reflected here. No longer does changing folder 
 or file names in File Explorer break RoboHelp. If you change the name 
 in Windows Explorer, note that as soon as you put focus back on RoboHelp, 
 the change will be shown.</p>
